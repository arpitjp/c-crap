Analysts say Netflix could be a costly option for many viewers, especially in the rural areas, compared to its competitors’ rates. Apart from this, Netflix
requires credit card details for the one-month, free-trial period. However, credit card frauds being common in India, people are suspicious and wary of
giving out information online. It is felt that this might discourage many from trying the service. Despite this, many of the urban and educated audience
have subscribed to Netflix in India, mainly due to the popularity of its original series productions such as Narcos and Jessica Jones.

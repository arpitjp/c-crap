Most basic function of heap is to increase data that can be entered.

    int howmany, total=0, i;
    int * no;                                                     //   define pointer variable
    float average;

    printf("how many you want to enter  :   ");
    scanf(" %d", &howmany);

    no = (int *)malloc(howmany * sizeof(int));      //   this is exactly how u use it
